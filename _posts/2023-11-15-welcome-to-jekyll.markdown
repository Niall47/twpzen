Here is my free book, The Idiot Lecture.
This is everything I used to claw my way from rock bottom, drowning in anxiety and depression, to becoming a really happy and enlightened man. I'm very proud of myself for pushing through the hard times, it has given me the skills and mental strength to deal with hard times, easily.

You don't have to do anything, ever. But these tips will give you the skills to pay your mental health bills, I double doggy dare you to read it all the way through ðŸ˜‰

Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
