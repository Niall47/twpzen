I'm very proud of myself for finally getting my first-ever ice bath done! Something that gave me so much anxiety about doing, I had a bazillion excuses, but I got it done! I had a few more in the bath and then bought myself a Lumi Pod for my garden and I get in there most mornings after calming down my nerves and silly excuses.

I honestly love it, it is so damn powerful for supercharging my mood and energy on top of all the health benefits!

## Extreme celeb reaction to breathing technique <br> 'Freeze the Fear with Wim Hof' - BBC

One of my favourite shows introduced UK celebrities to Wim Hof and they took on the challenge head on to see if this is all a scam or if it is the real deal. These reactions may seem a bit put on, but this is how it feels when you actually commit to trying it out! (Side note, this may make you cry but not in a sad way)

## This is the documentary that changed my life!

This documentary was the very beginning of my recovery and what led me to creating TwpZen.

I had been suggested to watch it by a friend, it was 5 am and I had just got home from a 13-hour night club shift.

I was rewarding myself with a mix of whiskey, sleeping tablets and a few joints, which I felt was ok and kinda normal at the time.

I hit play and was drawn in by these outrageous claims and yet these journalists seemed to have genuine reactions that seemed like something out of a weird film or cult. Ever the critic, I felt there was no way this stuff was legit, so as they explained the breathing method, I copied them at the same time and started the power breaths.

Not to sound dramatic but after one round, I burst into tears and a tonne of emotion came flooding through my body. I've never felt anything anywhere near close to it before or since. I felt like I was truly, deeply happy and overcome with joy. I couldn't stop smiling and cry laughing, it felt like I had been asleep my whole life, on battery saving mode and my entire soul rebooted. All of the trauma I was keeping in, a lifetime of tension and stress replaced with deep self-love and acceptance.

<em>I'll never forget that moment and how it changed my entire life.</em>

The breathing exercise alone 1000% changed my life and allowed me to get in touch with my inner bitch/child. We have had some good talks over the years and still, he tries to make me have a day off and curl up in bed.

But I have the knowledge now and most importantly, the memory and experience of knowing if I can push through this uncomfortable moment then I'm going to feel like the best version of myself again!
