I'm very proud of myself for finally getting my first-ever ice bath
done! Something that gave me so much anxiety about doing, I had a
bazillion excuses, but I got it done! I had a few more in the bath and
then bought myself a Lumi Pod for my garden and I get in there most
mornings after calming down my nerves and silly excuses.

I honestly love it, it is so damn powerful for supercharging my mood and
energy on top of all the health benefits!

## Extreme celeb reaction to breathing technique <br> 'Freeze the
Fear with Wim Hof' - BBC

One of my favourite shows introduced UK celebrities to Wim Hof and they
took on the challenge head on to see if this is all a scam or if it is
the real deal. These reactions may seem a bit put on, but this is how it
feels when you actually commit to trying it out! (Side note, this may
make you cry but not in a sad way)

## What happens to your body when doing the breathing method, using
fun, simple animations!

## This is the documentary that changed my life!

[![The Iceman

This documentary was the very beginning of my recovery and what led me
to creating TwpZen.

I had been suggested to watch it by a friend, it was 5am and I had just
got home from a 13 hour night club shift.

I was rewarding myself with a mix of whiskey, sleeping tablets and a few
joints, which I felt was ok and kinda normal at the time.

I hit play and was drawn in by these outrageous claims and yet these
journalists seemed to have genuine reactions that seemed like something
out of a weird film or cult. Ever the critic, I felt there was no way
this stuff was legit, so as they explained the breathing method, I
copied them at the same time and started the power breaths.

Not to sound dramatic but after one round, I burst into tears and a
tonne of emotion came flooding through my body. I've never felt
anything anywhere near close to it before or since. I felt like I was
truly, deeply happy and overcome with joy. I couldn't stop smiling and
cry laughing, it felt like I had been asleep my whole life, on battery
saving mode and my entire soul rebooted. All of the trauma I was keeping
in, a lifetime of tension and stress replaced with deep self love and
acceptance.

<em>I'll never forget that moment and how it changed my entire
life.</em>

The breathing exercise alone 1000% changed my life and allowed me to get
in touch with my inner bitch/child. We have had some good talks over the
years and still, he tries to make me have a day off and curl up in bed.

But I have the knowledge now and most importantly, the memory and
experience of knowing if I can push through this uncomfortable moment
then I'm going to feel like the best version of myself again!

<em>Don't be scared homie</em>, this is class and I use it daily. I
used to pay for the Wim Hof app, but money is tight and this free
version is easy to customise to your hearts content to ease in slowly

I'm sure you don't want to.

Just, <em>trust me? </em>



Look, I have talked to a lot of people about this stuff.

I can't remember the last time someone said they would give it a go and
didn't give me a shopping list of excuses. Most people would rather
avoid something that ends up being fun and incredibly good for your
physical health, brain and daily mood.

Just think of all the weak people you know, they'll **NEVER** try
this.



It's free, you can do it in total anonymity.

Don't let that inner bitch voice in your head stop you from being
better, that voice will be there until you are grey and old. <em>Deal
with it.</em>
