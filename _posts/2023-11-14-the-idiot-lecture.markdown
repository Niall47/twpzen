This is everything I used to claw my way from rock bottom, drowning in anxiety and depression, to becoming a really happy and enlightened man. I'm very proud of myself for pushing through the hard times, it has given me the skills and mental strength to deal with hard times, easily.

You don't have to do anything, ever. But these tips will give you the skills to pay your mental health bills, I double doggy dare you to read it all the way through ðŸ˜‰
